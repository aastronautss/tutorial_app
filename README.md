# tutorial_app

This is an application I am creating with heavy assistance from Michael Hartl's "Ruby on Rails Tutorial," a wonderful book that goes in more depth about the process of building a Rails application than any other free tutorial I have found. I am currently followling along with this tutorial alongside the Rails course in the Odin Project.

A version of the app is hosted on Heroku at https://tylers-tutorial-app.herokuapp.com

## Features
The Ruby on Rails Tutorial covers the following:

* MVC Architecture with RESTful routing
* User sign-ups
* User log-in and log-out
* Persistent sessions
